## Components & Documentation

You can explore components and samples with the [playground](https://mgt.dev) powered by storybook.

The Toolkit currently includes the following components:

* [mgt-login](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/components/login)
* [mgt-person](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/components/person)
* [mgt-person-card](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/components/person-card)
* [mgt-people](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/components/people)
* [mgt-people-picker](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/components/people-picker)
* [mgt-agenda](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/components/agenda)
* [mgt-tasks](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/components/tasks)
* [mgt-get](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/components/get)
* [mgt-teams-channel-picker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/toolkit/components/teams-channel-picker)

The components work best when used with a [provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/providers). The provider handles authentication and the requests to the Microsoft Graph APIs used by the components. The Toolkit contains the following providers:

* [Msal Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/providers/msal)
* [SharePoint Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/providers/sharepoint)
* [Teams Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/providers/teams)
* [Proxy Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/providers/proxy)
* [Simple Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/providers/custom)

You can also create your own providers by extending the [IProvider](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/providers/custom) abstract class.

## Getting Started

The following guides are available to help you get started with the Toolkit:
* [Build a web application (vanilla JS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/get-started/build-a-web-app)
* [Build a SharePoint Web Part](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/get-started/build-a-sharepoint-web-part)
* [Build a Microsoft Teams Tab](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/get-started/build-a-microsoft-teams-tab)
* [Use the Toolkit with React](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/get-started/use-toolkit-with-react)
* [Use the Toolkit with Angular](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/get-started/use-toolkit-with-angular)

You can use the components by referencing the loader directly (via unpkg), or installing the npm package

### Use via mgt-loader:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@microsoft/mgt/dist/bundle/mgt-loader.js"></script>
```

You can then start using the components in your html page. Here is a full working example with the Msal provider:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@microsoft/mgt/dist/bundle/mgt-loader.js"></script>
<mgt-msal-provider client-id="[CLIENT-ID]"></mgt-msal-provider>
<mgt-login></mgt-login>

<!-- <script>
    // alternatively, you can set the provider in code and provide more options
    mgt.Providers.globalProvider = new mgt.MsalProvider({clientId: '[CLIENT-ID]'});
</script> -->
```

> NOTE: MSAL requires the page to be hosted in a web server for the authentication redirects. If you are just getting started and want to play around, the quickest way is to use something like [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in vscode.

### Use via NPM:

The benefits of using MGT through NPM is that you have full control of the bundling process and you can bundle only the code you need for your site. First, add the npm package:

```bash
npm install @microsoft/mgt
```

Now you can reference all components at the page you are using:

```html
<script src="node_modules/@microsoft/mgt/dist/es6/components.js"></script>
```

Or, just reference the component you need and avoid loading everything else:

```html
<script src="node_modules/@microsoft/mgt/dist/es6/components/mgt-login/mgt-login.js"></script>
```

Similarly, to add a provider, you can add it as a component:

```html
<script src="node_modules/@microsoft/mgt/dist/es6/components/providers/mgt-msal-provider.js"></script>

<mgt-msal-provider client-id="[CLIENT-ID]"></mgt-msal-provider>
```

or, add it in your code:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { Providers, MsalProvider } from '@microsoft/mgt';

  Providers.globalProvider = new MsalProvider({ clientId: '[CLIENT-ID]' });
</script>
```

or, if you already use MSAL.js and have a `UserAgentApplication`, you can use it:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { Providers, MsalProvider } from '@microsoft/mgt';

  const app = new UserAgentApplication({ auth: { clientId: '[CLIENT-ID]' } });

  Providers.globalProvider = new MsalProvider({ userAgentApplication: app });
</script>
``` 

## Running the samples

Some of our samples are coupled to use the locally built mgt packages instead of the published version from npm. Becuase of this, it's helpful to build the monorepo before attempting to run any of the samples.

```bash
# Starting at the root
yarn
yarn build
# Now you can run the React sample using the local packages
cd ./samples/react-app/
yarn start
```

This also means that running the samples in isolation may fail if there are breaking changes between the published version of mgt and the local copy. 
To workaround this, use samples that are known to be compatible with a specific release by checking out the appropriate branch or tag first.
