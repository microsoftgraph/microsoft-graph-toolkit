## Microsoft Graph Toolkit: UI Components and Authentication Providers for Microsoft Graph

The Microsoft Graph Toolkit is a collection of reusable, framework-agnostic components and authentication providers for accessing and working with Microsoft Graph. The components are fully functional right of out of the box, with built in providers that authenticate with and fetch data from Microsoft Graph.

The Microsoft Graph Toolkit makes it easy to use Microsoft Graph in your application. In the following example, a signed in user and their calendar events are displayed with just two lines of code by using the [Login](?path=/story/components-mgt-login--login) and [Agenda](?path=/story/components-mgt-agenda--simple) components.

<p>This site is providing documentation for version {PACKAGE_VERSION} of the Microsoft Graph Toolkit.</p>

### Installing the Microsoft Graph Toolkit

It's easy to get started! Add the Toolkit via our `mgt-loader` or via npm and you are ready to go!

#### Via the mgt-loader

/>

#### Via npm

<Source
 language="shell"
 code={`npm install @microsoft/mgt@${PACKAGE_VERSION}`}

### What's in the Microsoft Graph Toolkit?

#### Components

The Microsoft Graph Toolkit includes a collection of web components for the most commonly built experiences powered by Microsoft Graph APIs.

The components are also available as [React components](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/get-started/mgt-react).
