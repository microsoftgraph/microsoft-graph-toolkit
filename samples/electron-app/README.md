# Sample for Microsoft Graph Toolkit Electron Provider
The [Microsoft Graph Toolkit (mgt)](https://aka.ms/mgt) library is a collection of authentication providers and UI components powered by Microsoft Graph. 

The `@microsoft/mgt-electron-provider` package exposes the `ElectronAuthenticator` and `ElectronProvider` classes which use [MSAL node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/msal-node) to sign in users and acquire tokens to use with Microsoft Graph.

This sample shows how the ElectronProvider works in a simple Electron application.
