# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is an admin interface to test the `@microsoft/mgt-components` and `@microsoft/mgt-react` packages.

## Available Scripts

In the root directory for the repository:

```
yarn && yarn build && yarn watch:react
```

This will:
- install all necessary dependencies
- build the required `@microsoft/mgt-*` libraries
- start this sample app while watching for changes in the `@microsoft/mgt-components` package and its dependecies

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
